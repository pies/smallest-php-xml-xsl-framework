#summary the Smallest PHP XML/XSL Framework!

= Introduction =

PHP community is very lazy with XML applications and XML standards. There are no good XML framework, notorious problems with _SimpleXML_ (a "read-only" map of XML-to-array),  and no direct support to _xQuery 1.0_ and _XSLT 2.0_.
But PHP with _XSLT 1.0_, read/write XML files, read/write XML at database... it rocks!

This "Smallest PHP XML/XSL Framework" is for demonstrates how to work with PHP, XML and XSLT, in a minimal framework, and without restricting to a MVC pattern. 

= Version 1.0 of 2010=
It was a first seminal work, showing what is a "mininal framework" to build sites with XML, XSLT and PHP.

= Version 2.X of 2011=
We added some minimal features to the framework, to do "real world" applications:

- XSLT can see page state (POST/GET/SESSION variables);

- XSLT can use XML-on-fly build by PHP (see FORM);

- use of different XSLT-article standars, as NLM example.

- sitemap+skyn permits submenu navigation.

== Installation ==

1- copy all zip source-code to a /www directory. Example: /var/www/smallest-php-xml-xsl-framework

2- Access it with your web browser. Example: http://localhost/smallest-php-xml-xsl-framework

3- Navigate. If any error, check folder permissions and, check if all XML and XSL PHP-configurations are enabled.

== Do your experiments ==
Change code and test by your self. Example:

- change the conf.php file to adapt for another application.

- change title attributes at xml/site (the site map).

- change the xml/pages files (they are the page contents).

- change the css/skin1.css adn/or xsl/SKIN1.xsl files (they express the site layout).
