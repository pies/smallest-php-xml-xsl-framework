This project intend to be the "_Smallest PHP/XML/XSL website framework_".

It is a simple and didactic way to learn how to work with a (standard) XSLT 1.0 template engine in a PHP development context, and how to use XML datebase to produce web content.

= Introduction =

PHP community is very lazy with XML applications and XML standards. There are no good XML framework, notorious problems with _SimpleXML_ (a "read-only" map of XML-to-array),  and no direct support to _xQuery 1.0_ and _XSLT 2.0_.
But PHP with _XSLT 1.0_, read/write XML files, read/write XML at database... it rocks!

This "Smallest PHP XML/XSL Framework" is for demonstrates how to work with PHP, XML and XSLT, in a minimal framework, and without restricting to a MVC pattern. 

== Scope ==
The aim is not to produce a "really very small" peace of code, the minimal framework need,
 * Use XML files or XML records (from database) as input;
 * Use XSLT (with CSS) as _template language_;
 * Supply templates with "page state" and another mixed data;
 * Use PHP also as a template language (!) and also for produce input date.

To to test if the little framework achieve these goals, it is inserted into a "website controler" application.
 
== History ==
In 2008 Tatarynowicz wanted to see how feasible it is to create a simple, portable system in which data is stored as XML and templates as XSL. He developed a little framework that  outputs XHTML 1.0 Strict pages, and manipulate page structure at any stage using standard XML/XSL tools.

[http://sputnik.pl/pies/framework/ It works] and the source code was the <tt>smallest-php-xml-xsl-framework 1.0</tt>; but, like other PHP+XSLT examples, the way it's implemented, everything is too strict and limited to work in real world imo. Tatarynowicz lost interest in XSLT as a templating language.


In 2011 PPKrauss find Tatarynowicz's work and used it as the "simple and didactic XSLT+PHP" framework implementation, augmenting the original software with some "real world" behaviours, producing the <tt>smallest-php-xml-xsl-framework 2.0</tt>.

= Version 1.0 of 2010=
It was a first seminal work, showing what is a "mininal framework" to build sites with XML, XSLT and PHP.

= Version 2.X of 2011=
We added some minimal features to the framework, to do "real world" applications:

- XSLT can see page state (POST/GET/SESSION variables);

- XSLT can use XML-on-fly build by PHP (see FORM);

- use of different XSLT-article standars, as NLM example.

- sitemap+skyn permits submenu navigation.

== Installation ==

1- copy all zip source-code to a /www directory. Example: /var/www/smallest-php-xml-xsl-framework

2- Access it with your web browser. Example: http://localhost/smallest-php-xml-xsl-framework

3- Navigate. If any error, check folder permissions and, check if all XML and XSL PHP-configurations are enabled.

== Do your experiments ==
Change code and test by your self. Example:

- change the conf.php file to adapt for another application.

- change title attributes at xml/site (the site map).

- change the xml/pages files (they are the page contents).

- change the css/skin1.css adn/or xsl/SKIN1.xsl files (they express the site layout).
